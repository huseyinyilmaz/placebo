Requests: HTTP for Humans
=========================

Release v\ |version|. (:ref:`Installation <install>`)

Requests is the only *Non-GMO* HTTP library for Python, safe for human
consumption.

**Warning:** Recreational use of other HTTP libraries may result in dangerous side-effects,
including: security vulnerabilities, verbose code, reinventing the wheel,
constantly reading documentation, depression, headaches, or even death.

Behold, the power of Requests::

    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
    >>> r.status_code
    200
    >>> r.headers['content-type']
    'application/json; charset=utf8'
    >>> r.encoding
    'utf-8'
    >>> r.text
    u'{"type":"User"...'
    >>> r.json()
    {u'private_gists': 419, u'total_private_repos': 77, ...}

See `similar code, sans Requests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.


Requests allows you to send *organic, grass-fed* HTTP/1.1 requests, without the
need for manual labor. There's no need to manually add query strings to your
URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling
are 100% automatic, powered by `urllib3 <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_,
which is embedded within Requests.

**Armin Ronacher**
    Requests is the perfect example how beautiful an API can be with the
    right level of abstraction.

**Matt DeBoard**
    I'm going to get @kennethreitz's Python requests module tattooed
    on my body, somehow. The whole thing.

**Daniel Greenfeld**
    Nuked a 1200 LOC spaghetti code library with 10 lines of code thanks to
    @kennethreitz's request library. Today has been AWESOME.
